OK here is the problem Cartoon network was already making enough money of ben 10 so why would they bother putting any effort into it when they could just make garbage i mean they obviously think kids are that stupid since they think they would watch any type of garbage thrown at them and by the way talagbe ''it's for kids'' is not an excuse for this piece of crap and ''it's for kids'' is not an excuse for lazyness do you honestly think that this is what kids deserve huh? and no it's not amazing it's far from that you wanna see amazing? look at steven universe now that is amazing this piece of cash grabbing trash will never be as good as steven universe

Just...Why?

If Omniverse was horrific then this is so beyond horrible that there is no word in the English language that can be used to describe this failure of an animated production that has been my displeasure to view.

This series is absolute retardation and I mean that in the very literal sense of the word.

It is dumbed down so far from the original Ben 10 that it irritates me to no end that this is part of an almost completely otherwise successful and enjoyable franchise.

The episodes have even been segmented into 11 minute shorts of some random, goofy, comical adventure that includes one morale of the story ending or another. It is suited solely for audiences of as minimal of an attention span as possible...the Cartoon Network demographic.

This series is garbage. It is unoriginal. And is nothing more than another product of executive greed.

I don't know what I expected

What do you say to series who's feature images contain a pile of Dino crap from Jurassic Park? Has there ever been a bigger middle finger than this? OK yeah there was Teen Titans Go and Powerpuff Girls 2016 I guess.

But here's the biggest issue I have with this show. It's a reboot. And I understand that Ben 10 has had a few reboots before (see my review on Omniverse) but this is an insult. Possibly worse than Omniverse.

Actually I can't compare it to Omniverse, because that at least has an original story-line, new likable characters and in some cases, acceptable animation. This is no excuse. Not only is this another reboot, but it's just a complete rehash of the original plot with maybe one or two new aliens thrown in. As if that's a good distraction...

This is just another bad reboot by Cartoon Network, which is not that surprising, that some how got lower scores than the two reboot shows before it. At this point, it may just be better off to not watch this show, so that way maybe CN will figure out we're done with these revamped shows.

Few things of what a reboot should NOT be

Author: Watcher from United States

Oh boy, where to start? First off, I don't mind comedy, but when a show that 's about a boy fighting villains/aliens there should be more action like in the original or squeals, not just meme faces or trying to hip constantly.

Okay on to my next thing, when you hear the word reboot you expect a show to be new but still kind of sticking to the original story and characters right (like Thunder Cats and Looney Tune show)? Like take for example, Gwen. You know in the original Gwen and Ben's relationship didn't start off sunshine and flowers; but for some odd reason they made Gwen in the reboot seem too much of a doormat towards Ben? It's boring to see them just agreeing with each other without really seeing how their relationship mend from being two bickering cousins to good friends.

Then finally... the lazy design. I get it, they probably want to save money, but it's just so ugly looking. Even made me think it was that Scooby Doo reboot show.

Yuck...

This show is just awful when compared to the other 4 series. The first three were all amazing, omniverse was bad, but at least not this bad. The show lacks anything that makes it stand out. I feel like cartoon network basically just wanted to keep riding the gravy train of Ben 10 while keeping the audience age group to 8 to 12 years old.

Why not continue Ultimate Alien and allow it to reach the generation that actually grew up watching Ben 10. A lot of TV shows did this and are still very popular today. I mean even look at Harry Potter. The first movie was extremely childish and simple while the last two were very mature and contained swearing.

Please Cartoon Network, make a continuation of Ben 10 Ultimate Alien in the same art style for a mature audience.

I'm just confused at this point

Cartoon Network's been confusing me lately. They keep pumping out reboots with such a little crap, it's kinda sad. This reboot isn't as bad as PPG 2016, but it still isn't good by any means. I hope they realize that kids grow up with their shows, and that makes me sad, knowing that kids obliviously watch these cheap, pathetic reboots made just to sell McDonalds toys. I'm not giving it a 1 because the episodes suck, (they're more lazy and meh) I'm giving it a 1 because the soullessness and lack of heart behind the show. To any kids who see this review 20 years in the future, I'm sorry you grew up with this modern Cartoon Network, with constant re-runs of TTG and their pathetic reboots. I know Cartoon Network is a business, and they need money, but you can make a show good, AND care about money at the same time.

A huge downgrade

*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Ben 10 has been a series for a long time that has contributed a lot in many childhoods. Whether it was the original in 2005, the spin-offs in 2009, 2011, or 2013, it left some impact on its fans. These shows all gave something memorable and left companies giving out toys and merchandise. But recently, Cartoon Network decided to give this series a reboot and it follows the same route as "Teen Titans Go!" and "Powerpuff Girls (2016)". The animation is cute, bright, and it is more childish as ever. So childish, they might as well start another channel called "Cartoon Network Jr". Some problems with the animation is that nothing feels original or unique. It feels bland and boring. Even on the aliens, it feels lifeless. But perhaps the biggest sin of all is the voices. CN wisely reprises Tara Strong as Ben, but went with new actors for each new role, and it feels off and awful. Other Ben shows and animated movies kept the same actors and there were no problem, why change it? Anyway, the new voices for the characters are too generic and safe. There are no risks, no differences, just basic generic splooge. And the characters feel re-written. Defined characters that were established, now changed. Gwen is too nice and Grandpa Max is useless. Please pass on this show.

First Teen Titans,then the powerpuff girls,and now Ben 10 are all ruined thanks to Cartoon Network

I remember when I was a kid and my twin brother and I usually watched the original Ben 10 in the afternoon or on the weekends if nothing else was on and it was a very good show to watch. Now thanks to Cartoon Network, they turned a show from my childhood into something that makes you lose your brain cells just like they did to Teen Titans Go! and The Powerpuff Girls.And I watched a episode of the reboot of Ben 10 at the airport one time while I waiting for my flight,and I have to say this show feels like a joke from somebody at Cartoon Network.

Gotta pay the bills

Listen, I grew up with Ben 10. It may even be my favorite cartoon series of all time. I've seen all of it of every series. So, when I saw this reboot, I was excited to see more Ben 10. But, one has to ask, when making a reboot, why? There has to be a reason for a reboot. A reboot should improve upon its source material in a unique way, setting it apart from the source while staying true enough to it to even be called a reboot. Now, I have to say, this show is funny. Not all the times and sometimes the joke isn't well placed or there's too much at one time but, most of the time, it's pretty comical. Alright, I like to give credit where credit is due. Ben 10 (2017) is bad. The characters are shells of what they used to be, they are all really dumb and all the episodes and characters are just flat and uninteresting. This show is another Teen Titans GO! It is funny because everything goes by fast. But that only amounts in quick laughs and a sense of unfulfillment.

We didn't need or want this abomination

*** This review may contain spoilers ***
OK who asked for this I'm being honest here we just had omniverse 2 or 3 years ago which wasn't all that good now we have this which makes omniverse look like a diamond. The whole show is to demolish on the original series and just for merchandise. Don't let me forget that this reboot is incredibly lazy the show is a copy and paste to the original show except throw away all the drama, tension, and good character development and add more stupid comedy that makes a 3 year old laugh. The reason I say this is lazy and is a copy and paste is one of the episodes I watched was an episode on Ben going to a wrestling match cause Grandpa Max said that he isn't a wrestling champion cause he played a virtual game but I don't remember the plot but this episode was the exact same thing as another episode in the original that is why I call it a copy and paste show. Don't forget the characters are abominations Ben is a mindless bumbling dweeb Gwen is completely different. in the original she and ben fought a lot but now she agrees on everything ben says and don't you dare get me started with Grandpa Max. Also what was the villain in the original again a terrifying overpowered squid octopus liked creature that was frightening the main villain in the reboot a.. scientist with a... bugs body YOU KIDDING ME. However In my opinion my least favorite thing was the aliens back then they were awesome, disgusting, cool, and ETC. They ruined stinkfly the most I mean back then stinkfly was probably one of the most disgusting things that came from a cartoon which was the point but now he looks more like a kids Halloween costume. I also hated the alien transformations seeing ben with that stupid smile now correct me if I am incorrect but in the original Ben had a secret identity instead he goes to a water park and transforming into aliens going on water slides. The alien are more like Halloween costumes than something not from this planet I know there aiming it for kids to make them more stupid cause cartoons nowadays but come on these designs aren't good they are more human like and those aren't the ben 10 aliens that I knew were so great which was the design and character. Apparently they screwed the aliens abilities as well for example Upgrade can control things with technological component like for example a skateboard. Now this has been CNs trend do say screw you to the viewers and ruin the shows back then and of course make mindless cartoons for kids and I know they wont listen to us cause merchandise is more important to them but that's OK cartoon network show these stupid shows like TTG PPGR and you lose viewers your choice but you screw more viewers when you keep doing these things.
